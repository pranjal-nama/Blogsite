                            <br>This is not just a quote for me, it is the thought which gives me strength from inside. I have always been in the search of love but never thought that i can find love in myself too. It was not an easy journey.
                            <br>From my childhood i was concerned about the way i look, i dress and so many things. I always wanted to look the perfect. 
                            <br>And then here comes a major so called problem in my life 'the size of my boobs'. When every girl was hitting her puberty i was too going through that but i can't see so many changes in my body except i got my periods.. i mean my boobs are not growing as the same speed as of other girls and at that time it was a big issue for me because i too wanted that everyone consider me beautiful and at that time i thought having a specific type of body is what people called 'BEAUTY'. I never shared this feeling with anyone i always just pretended to be happy to everyone so that no one can know i'm bothered about this thing. I always wondered why god why you doing this to me...
                            
                            <br>Then after sometime i went to a boarding school. There i heard a lot about me, my body, my boobs." Are you doing anything for your boobs, kitne chote hain... nimbu..hahaha". Yup and so many more, that was funny for them but not for me. There was a time anyone who passes by me gives me some kind of advice to how to increase boobs and literally i was tired of hearing all that. 
                            
                            <br> I keep on trying to talk about this to my mother. I was scared she will probably say why are you thinking about all these things aren't you concentrating on your studies. It's not that i haven't talked to mom but i got same answers as i thought and when the first time i told my mother that i too wanted big boobs, why don't i have and i want bra too because so many girls told me wearing a bra can increase my breast size... my mom looked at me and asked me 'kin dosto ke sath rehne lagi ho aajkal' bas uske baad se kabhi kuch bola hi nahi mene maa se iss baare mai.
                            
                            <br>One thing i loved was making people smile and i guess this is the most important part of my journey to loving myself. I observed people laugh when they talk about my boobs, when they taunt on me.And then i got an idea that why not make fun of yourself. I guess the day i started this, there was not a single person who can laugh on me. I learned a thing then, 
                            
                                        <br><br>"If you love yourself the way you are, then it doesn't matter what people are saying"
                            
                            <br>But this was just the starting for me towards self love. Yup i didn't overcome all my fears and complexes but i was more confident, more happy than before.
                            From that day everything changed for me.</p>
