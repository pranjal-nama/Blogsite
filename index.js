//     I never knew that someday i'll be going to write a blog but yeah here i am. I always wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with everyone.
    
//     I'm a life lover and live every little moment of my life. I want this to be an awesome journey. I guess life teaches us at every step, sometimes we learn and sometimes we just go with the flow.
//     Loving yourself is the most important part of your life . From the day i started loving myself, everything changed, everything seemed a little easy.
//     One thing i learned about life is that life goes on, no matter what. You must live the life to its fullest. And never give yourself the chance for any regrets.
//     And sometimes my mind feels like trapped. I'm a person lost in my own thoughts, trying to know me better and this world too.
//      So let's begin this journey.....❤️");
